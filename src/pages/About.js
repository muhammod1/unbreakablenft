          Unbroken NFTs is a collection that tells the fictional story of
          fifteen (15) unique characters from diverse cultural backgrounds. They
          were victims of bullying who transitioned to become successful by
          overcoming the pains they went through.

            This fictional story was created from the results of our survey,
            which was conducted in February 2022. We received over 450 responses
            within one week, highlighting the ugly experiences of victims in the
            hands of bullies and how those experiences shaped them. About 85% of
            the victims experienced bullying during their high school education.

            While some anti-bullying organizations in countries like Canada, the
            United Kingdom, and the United States carry out annual projects to
            address the issue of bullying in high schools, we did not find any
            active organizations doing similar things in Nigeria and Africa at
            large.
